## Requirements

* ArcGIS Desktop 10.1 (or later) with Advanced License
    *  ArcGIS Desktop Advanced License is required to change Representation Rules (e.g. in Append Military Features Tool)
* Apache Ant - used to download and extract dependent data and run test drivers
* To build the .NET Solution source in source\AppendMilitaryFeaturesCS you will also need
    * Visual Studio 2010 or later
    * ArcObjects .NET Engine or Desktop Development Kit
    * If you do not require the Append Military Features Tool, you may skip this requirement

## Instructions

### General Help
[New to Github? Get started here.](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/Esri/esri.github.com/blob/master/help/esri-getting-to-know-github.html)

### Getting Started with the toolbox
* Download required data dependencies 
    * Install and configure Apache Ant
        * Download Ant from the [Apache Ant Project](http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi) and unzip to a location on your machine
        * Set environment variable `ANT_HOME` to Ant Install Location
        * Add Ant\bin to your path: `%ANT_HOME%\bin`
        * NOTE: Ant requires Java [Runtime Environment (JRE) or Developer Kit (JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) to be installed and the environment variable `JAVA_HOME` to be set to this location
        * To verify your Ant Installation: Open Command Prompt> `ant -h` and verify it runs and returns the ant help correctly 
    * To download the data dependencies 
        * Open Command Prompt>
        * `cd military-feature-toolbox`
        * `> ant`
        * Verify “Build Succeeded”  
        * This will create a directory military-feature-toolbox/data with required data files
* IMPORTANT: Update the local ArcGIS Military Style Files to the latest versions from the [military-features-data repository](https://raw.github.com/Esri/military-features-data)
    * This data is automatically downloaded by the ant script above, but you must manually copy the files to the ArcGIS styles folder
    * To accomplish this:
    * Navigate to the folders
        *  military-features-data\data\mil2525c\stylefiles
        *  military-features-data\data\app6b\stylefiles
    * Update/copy all of the .style files from each folder into your ArcGIS Desktop Style folder (overwrite if necessary)
    * For example, copy the style files from above location into this Desktop Folder:
    	* {ArcGIS Install Location}\ArcGIS\Desktop10.X\Styles
* Open and build the Visual Studio Solution at military-feature-toolbox\source\AppendMilitaryFeaturesCS
    * To use MSBuild to build the solution
        * Open a Visual Studio Command Prompt: Start Menu | Microsoft Visual Studio 2010/2012 | Visual Studio Tools | Developer Command Prompt for VS 2010/2012
        * `cd military-feature-toolbox\source\AppendMilitaryFeaturesCS`
        * `msbuild AppendMilitaryFeatures2010.sln /property:Configuration=Release`
            * NOTE: if you recieve an error message: `'msbuild' is not recognized` 
            * You may need to add the path the .NET Framework SDK (if multiple SDKs are installed)
            * E.g. `set path=%path%;C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319`
* (Optional) Test the command line AppendMilitaryFeatures application
    * `cd military-feature-toolbox\application`
    * `> AppendMilitaryFeatures.exe`
    * Verify `AppendMilitaryFeatures.exe Succeeded.`
    * This will verify that the data, products, and licenses necessary to run the application are installed
    * Note: this will run with default values of (1) data\shapefiles\FriendlyForcesSmall.shp (2) data\geodatabases\test_outputs.gdb (3) Symbol_ID
* (Optional) Start ArcMap or ArcCatalog and run the Append Military Features Geoprocessing Tool at military-feature-toolbox\toolboxes
    *  IMPORTANT: the output military feature geodatabase must not be open in any other application or the tool will fail with "can not obtain Schema Lock" error
* To run all GP Tool unit tests
    * Open Command Prompt>
    * `> cd military-feature-toolbox\source\test\TestGPTools`
    * `> ant`
    * Verify "Build Succeeded"
